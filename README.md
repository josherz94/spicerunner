# # Spicerunner
Spicerunner is a 2d action game.
In this game you take a hold of our protagonist Rogerâ€™s spaceship, Vulcan,
and fight through waves of enemies to achieve a high score to move on to the end mission boss.
The game is still in alpha phase, and will be worked on incrementally as I have time to do so.
The end goal is to turn this game into a rogue-like that rewards the player based on how far they 
progressed in the game, and punishes by making them restart from the beginning. A full upgrade system and
inventory system are planned for future implementations.

## General info
As of today there are a total of 3 missions with a boss battle at the end of each. Every mission is incrementally harder
and makes you gain more points per mission to get to that next boss fight. The game comes included with a custom sound track
that I made with bosca ceoil to give to coincide with it's a vibrant 16-bit feel.

## Power Drops 
* A shield generator that provides invincibility for a set amount of time:
